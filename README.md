# data-utils
Some simple utilities to help with managing large sets of files.

# get_hash.py
- This script is useful for hashing all the files in the superdirectory. I mostly use this to quickly verify torrent files, as well as prepare a list of hashes when uploading a torrent.
- Usage: ``python3 get_hash.py``

# search.py
- This script invokes zgrep to search through many archives for the specified word.
- Usage: ``python3 search.py searchstring``
